# bank_project
This is a little python coding project simulating a bank where you can have an account and do several transactions.  
main.py is just a short script with a couple of orders for debugging purposes.  
The project is in a very early stage just having an Account class which organizes account operations:  

<ul>
<li> creating an account </li>
<li> depositing or withdrawing money </li>
<li> showing the account's balance </li>
<li> deleting the account </li>  
</ul>

For the future there are a lot of ideas to implement:  

<ul>
<li> password encryption </li>
<li> saving accounts </li>
<li> saving account history </li>
<li> building a while True loop to make main.py more interactive </li>
<li> setting up a master account that can do all operations on all accounts </li>
<li> having individual credit limits for each account </li>
</ul>
